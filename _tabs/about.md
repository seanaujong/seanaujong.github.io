# Hello!

Thanks for stopping by my blog.

I write free, digestible content for anyone interested in computer science and software engineering. All opinions here are my own.

After graduating from UT Austin with a B.S. in Computer Science, I currently work as a Software Engineer at [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/). I've also previously worked at companies like [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) and [Paycom](https://www.paycom.com/).


# Persimmon Facts

Persimmons are a sweet, orange, fruit typically in season from October to December in the Northern Hemisphere.

Fuyu persimmons are my favorite fruit. They look like tomatoes. Unripened Fuyu persimmons are still sweet.

Hachiya persimmons are my least favorite fruit. They look like acorns. Unripened Hachiya persimmons are very bitter.

I always mistake Hachiya persimmons for Fuyu persimmons. Ripened Hachiya persimmons are supposedly very sweet, but I wouldn't know.
